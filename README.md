# Full stack TODO application

![Todo mockup](./documentation/todo-mockup.png)

You can practice everything you've learnt during the JavaScript orientation
period with this full stack exercise to deepen your knowledge.

## The project

Create a full stack todo application with database with the aim to get, store
todos in a database.

The user should have access to her/his data, manipulate it by updating or
deleting it.

As a general advice, don't spend too much time with the UI, rather concentrate
on the functionality.

The main focus should be to practice the client-server communication, sending
and receiving proper http requests and building/handling database. In addition,
writing tests where they are really needed.
